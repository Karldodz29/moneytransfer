Any disputes, actions, claims or causes of action arising out of or in connection with this agreement or the website shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in New York County, New York and to arbitration as stated herein. At the request of FALCONLOOP, any controversy or claim related to this agreement (“claim”) may be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the federal arbitration act (title 9, U. S. Code) (the “act”). The act will apply even though this agreement provides that it is governed by the laws of New York. Arbitration proceedings will be determined in accordance with the act, the rules and procedures for the arbitration of financial services disputes of jams/undisputed, llc, a Delaware limited liability company or any successor thereof (“jams”), except that discovery in said arbitration shall be limited in scope to the specifics of liability on the claim, and any discovery related to damages calculations or any financials shall be withheld until after liability has been decided by the arbitrator(s).

The arbitrator(s) will have the authority to decide whether any claim is barred by the statute of limitations and, if so, to dismiss the arbitration on that basis. For purposes of the application of the statute of limitations, the service on jams under applicable jams rules of a notice of claim is the equivalent of the filing of a lawsuit. Any dispute concerning this arbitration provision or whether a claim is arbitral shall be determined by the arbitrator(s). The arbitrator(s) shall have the power to award legal fees pursuant to the terms of this agreement. This paragraph does not limit the right of FALCONLOOP to: (i) exercise self-help remedies, such as but not limited to, setoff; (ii) initiate judicial or non-judicial foreclosure against any real or personal property collateral; (iii) exercise any judicial or power of sale rights, or (iv) act in a court of law to obtain an interim remedy, such as but not limited to, injunctive relief, writ of possession or appointment of a receiver, or additional or supplementary remedies.
